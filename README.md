What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project other then passing class was to use javascript in my webpage for the first time and figuring out how everyhting works.

Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 This was built to show us how to use javascript in a webrowser and to create a random generated password for a user, which lots of sites use no to make "strong passwords"
 the difference is that you get to choose the useable characters

What problem does it solve?
This helps people not use the same password for every login in and makes everything more secure

What did you learn?
I learned that javascript is hard/used in everything so this needs to be something we have a good grasp of also that we don't need it to be as long as we have it there is a shorter way to write all of this

What makes your project stand out?
The difficulty of this being my first javascript project was what stood out for me.
What stands out for the user is that it words and creates a password for them.


Amended forgot to have a "return" so my generator would load up before the user could load the page/click the button
